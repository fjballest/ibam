   ------------------------------------------


   **** IMPORTANT ****
   You must make before the ../share files.
   *******************


      After you have read ( really ) this file you can call `make'
   at your shell.

      With LBAM[txio]-1.0 files you have a object version of 
   portable text-input-output source code files.
   This README file is intended to allow you to
   use this version and to `make' the files that are needed.

   ** How to make LBAM[txio]-1.0 :
      --------------------

      You can type `make' to your shell and more help'll be here.

   ** How to use library LBAM[txio]-1.0 :
      ---------------------------

      Your C program must include "txio.h" and shared files
    and link with `ld' the `.o' files generated by make call along with
   shared `.o' files and your own `.o' files.

      Remember to read the compilation options in Makefile.help and
   in BABELROOT/src/Makefile.help ( type `make'  at shell prompt ), 
   and write your program consecuently;


   ** How to modify LBAM[txio]-1.0 :
      -----------------------

   * Source Structure :

      The directory tree is:

   BABELROOT
   |
   |----- src
   .   |---txio
   .   .    |----SCCS
   .   .    +----doc
      .    

      src      : contains source C
        txio  : text I/O source code.
        SCCS : contains every version of source code.
        doc  : contains source documentation.

   * Help files :

      The Makefile.help teach you to use make in this directory and
   the README file give you some hints to use ( and/or modify) source.

      The BABELROOT/src Makefile.help & README should help you a little
   more.

      You have ( Since Apr-17 1991 version ) a cross-reference-listing
   called   lbam.x. Use it to find identifiers along source code.
   First you'd number every xxx.h/xxx.c file. Do not use 'enum' keyword,
   your C compiler may allow it but cxref ( the program to generate a 
   cross-ref. listing ) does not know about enums. Do not use ANSI C , 
   in general, you'd use K&R C instead. Source files are checked in with
   SCCS, if you do not Know about it consult your Reference Manual (I) .
   If you have any question just mail me.
